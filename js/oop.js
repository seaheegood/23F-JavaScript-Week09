/* STEP 1a: Create a new object using a regular function */

/* STEP 1b: Use the console to create a new person, and then invoke the function represented by .greeting() */

/* STEP 2a: In order to be a bit more concise, JavaScript allows us to use constructor functions - 
rewrite the above function, without returning anything. Capitalize the name of the function. */

/* STEP 2b: Use the console to create a couple of different people, using the 'new' keyword, 
and again invoking the .greeting() method for each person */

/* STEP 3a: Build the complete constructor for the object Person (comment out the above function first).
 Include name (first and last), age, gender, interests, bio (function), and greeting (function). */

/* STEP 3b: Instantiate a new Person based on the above constructor */

/* STEP 3c: Attempt to access the various properties of person1 using the console. */
// person1['age']
// person1.interests[1]
// person1.bio()

/* STEP 4a: Alternatively, you can use the Object() constructor to create an object. eg. car*/

/* STEP 4b: Once 'car' is created, add various properties and methods… */

/* STEP 4c: Change some of the properties of 'car' in the console, then invoke the car.fun() function */

/* STEP 5a: Yet another approach is to use the create() method. 
Let's see how the above car object can be used to create another object */

/* STEP 5b: Output to the paragraph anotherCar.brand - you will see that it has retained the properties of the original object. */

// That's it! Now on to Lab 3...
// Create a JavaScript function that permits the creation of a hamburger object
// Consider that a hamburger has many options – that might include
/*
    different types of buns,
    vegetable garnishes, 
    assortments of cheeses, 
    specialty sauces, 
    different meat patties(beef, chicken, vegetarian), 
    single, double, or triple patty, 
    Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.
*/
// add some extra if you want
// Make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too
